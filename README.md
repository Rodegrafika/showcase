###Photo gallery created with Wordpress and React.js
<br>

### How is it built
The gallery is built in Wordpress as a headless CMS using React.js for the Front-End application. The content is provided through the WP REST API.


###What I've learned
The biggest part of the work was to adapt the style to the client wish using CSS and dealing with cross-browser compatibility. The client has a lot of user with an old browser and it was challenging to find a way to guarantee good user experience to most of the visitors.

Here are the links to tutorials I referred to during the Project:
